# Bezier Curve Editor for After Effects

## Bezier Editor ‚Äì Free, Open & Flow-like

A free extension for After Effects that lets you create and apply custom cubic Bezier easing curves to keyframes using an intuitive, interactive canvas. It‚Äôs like [Flow](https://aescripts.com/flow/) ‚Äî but free and open-source. I call it Flov.

I reinvented the wheel, as the old one was behind a paywall. Enjoy!

## Features

- Interactive canvas to edit cubic Bezier curves
- Input field for precise curve values (e.g., `0.25,0.1,0.25,1`)
- Presets for common easing curves
- "Copy" button to copy `cubic-bezier(a,b,c,d)` to the clipboard
- "Apply to AE" button to apply curves to selected keyframes
- Dark/light theme toggle

## Requirements

- Windows or macOS
- After Effects CS6 (12.0) or later (tested on 25.0)
- AEScripts ZXP Installer ([Download](https://aescripts.com/learn/zxp-installer))

## Installation

1. Download `BezierCurveEditor.zxp` (v1.0.0) from [GitHub](https://github.com/Vergil1000x/Bezier_Curve_Editor/releases/download/v1.0.0/BezierCurveEditor.zxp).
2. Install using AEScripts ZXP Installer:
   - Download and install AEScripts ZXP Installer from [here](https://aescripts.com/learn/zxp-installer).
   - Open ZXP Installer.
   - Drag `BezierCurveEditor.zxp` into the window or select it.
   - Install for After Effects.
3. In After Effects:
   - Go to `Edit > Preferences > General` (Windows) or `After Effects > Preferences > General` (macOS).
   - Check "Allow Extensions" or "Allow scripts to write files and access network".
   - Restart After Effects.
4. Open the extension: `Window > Extensions > Bezier Curve Editor`.

### Manual Installation (Alternative)

If the ZXP Installer fails, follow these steps:

1. Rename `BezierCurveEditor.zxp` to `BezierCurveEditor.zip` and extract it.
2. Copy the `BezierCurveEditor` folder to:
   - Windows: `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\CEP\extensions\`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/`
3. Enable debugging:
   - Windows: Run `reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Adobe\CSXS.12 /v PlayerDebugMode /t REG_SZ /d 1` in Command Prompt.
   - macOS: Run `defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.12 PlayerDebugMode 1` in Terminal.
4. In After Effects, enable "Allow Extensions" (see above) and restart.

## Usage

1. Open the extension: `Window > Extensions > Bezier Curve Editor`.
2. Create a curve:
   - Drag control points on the canvas to shape the curve.
   - Enter precise values in the input field (e.g., `0.25,0.1,0.25,1`).
   - Select a preset from the "Preset Curves" list.
3. Copy the curve: Click "Copy" to save the `cubic-bezier(...)` value to your clipboard.
4. Apply to keyframes:
   - Select a layer in After Effects with keyframes (e.g., position or opacity).
   - Click "Apply to AE" to apply the curve to the selected keyframes.
   - If no keyframes are selected, an error message will appear.
5. Toggle themes: Use the theme button to switch between dark and light modes.

## Tips: Custom Bezier Curves

1. Create custom curves using tools like [Flow](https://aescripts.com/flow/) or [cubic-bezier.com](https://cubic-bezier.com).
2. Edit the `graphs.json` file in the extension folder:
   - Windows: `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\CEP\extensions\BezierCurveEditor\graphs.json`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/BezierCurveEditor\graphs.json`
3. Add curves in this format:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "label": "Custom Ease",
       "value": "custom_ease",
       "tooltip": "Custom: Smooth Ease",
       "bezier": "0.25,0.1,0.25,1",
       "group": "Custom"
     }
   ]
   ```
4. Save the file. Your custom curves will appear in the preset list.
5. Share `graphs.json` with others for personal use.

## Troubleshooting

- **Extension Not Appearing**: Ensure "Allow Extensions" is enabled in After Effects preferences and restart the application.
- **Installation Fails**: Use manual installation if ZXP Installer fails. Verify the extension folder path and debugging setting.
- **Apply to AE Fails**: Select a layer with keyframes before clicking "Apply to AE". Check the error message in the extension for details.
- **Hidden Files**: If the extension folder is not visible, enable hidden files in File Explorer (Windows) or use Finder‚Äôs ‚ÄúGo to Folder‚Äù (macOS).
